                    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language.
                    HTML is an abbreviation of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web
                    pages. The markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the
                    structure of web pages. HTML 5 is the fifth and current version of HTML. It has improved the markup
                    available for documents and has introduced application programming interfaces(API) and Document
                    Object Model(DOM).

                <h1>Why HTML is used ?</h1>
                <p>
                    HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. HTML gives authors the means to:
                    Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc. Retrieve online
                    information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.
                    HTML5 combines HTML, CSS3 and Java script technologies and shows impressive results unreachable with
                    simple HTML means.
                <h2>The Rules behind HTML5</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>New features should be based on HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Reduce the need for external plugins (like Flash)</li>
                    <li>Better error handling</li>
                    <li>More markup to replace scripting</li>
                    <li>HTML5 should be device independent</li>
                    <li>The development process should be visible to the public</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Basics of HTML5</h1>
                <p>
                    HTML5 was initially created by WHATWG (web hypertext application technology working group) with the
                    name “Web Application 1.0” in 2004. Apple, Mozilla and Opera started up WHATWG as a result of W3C
                    saying no to extend HTML. In 2007, W3C dropped egg-bound XHTML2 and moved its step to form HTMLWG
                    working together with WHATWG to create HTML5.

                    The first draft of HTML5 was released in 2008. The final spec of HTML5 won't be ready until 2022,
                    but you don't have to wait that long to start using it today and build really advanced web apps.

                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.
                    For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or
                    using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic
                    understanding of HTML and its functions.
                    <br><br>
                    HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the
                    content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or
                    image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so
                    on.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="heading" id="head">
                <h1>Head Tag</h1>
                <p>
                    The head element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the html tag
                    and the body tag.
                    <br><br>
                    Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
                    <br><br>
                    Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta
                    information.
                    <br><br>
                    The following elements can go inside the head element:
                <ul>
                    <li>Title</li>
                    <li>Style</li>
                    <li>Base</li>
                    <li>Link</li>
                    <li>Meta</li>
                    <li>Script</li>
                    <li>Noscript</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="heading" id="pic">
                <h1>Picture Tag</h1>
                <p>
                    The "Picture" tag gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.
                    <br><br>
                    The most common use of the "picture" element will be for art direction in responsive designs.
                    Instead of having one image that is scaled up or down based on the viewport width, multiple
                    images can be designed to more nicely fill the browser viewport.
                    <br><br>
                    The "Picture" element contains two tags:
                <ul>
                    <li>Source</li>
                    <li>Image</li>
                </ul>
                Example of an image is below here:
                <br>
                <picture>
                    <source media="(min-width : 1000px)"
                        srcset="https://i0.wp.com/owlovertheworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1-1.jpg?w=1024&ssl=1">
                    <img src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/41/2d/80/waterton-lake-national.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1"
                        alt="Mountain_View">
                </picture>
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
